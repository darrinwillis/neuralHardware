<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>We will be investigating an implementation of Neural Networks into a low-energy FPGA implementation. Neural Networks are a common machine learning algorithm with a high potential for parallelization, which can be exploited by hardware.</p>

<h2>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>An artificial neural network is a statistical learning algorithm involving layers of nodes, called perceptrons, which process information in a way that approximates an unknown function. Starting from an input layer, information is filtered, modified, and passed down through a series of hidden layers until reaching the final output layer. One of the major uses of neural networks involves their ability to discern the underlying function connected a set of input values to a set of output values.</p>

<p>Our goal will be to train a neural network with one hidden layer. Each input node will send it’s weighted input to all nodes in our hidden layer. The hidden layer nodes will then apply a sigmoid function 1/(1+e^(-x)), where x is the sum of their corresponding inputs. Finally, these values are sent to the single output node in the same fashion and modified to return a meaningful output. </p>

<p>The key to this training process lies in the set of weights given to the input values. We will be configuring these weights based on training data with known outputs for certain inputs. The weight calculations will be done using the backpropagation algorithm. This algorithm essentially iterates through the training dataset and alters the weights until we reach a certain error threshold. </p>

<p>Sequential implementation of Backpropagation algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>while(previous error > error) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for(each test datapoint) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(each hidden node) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum = 0;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(each input node)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum += weight * input;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hidden_value = 1/(1+Math.exp(-sum));<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum = 0;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(each hidden node)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum += weight * hidden_value<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output_value = 1/(1+Math.exp(-sum));<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error += (output_value - true_value)^2;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output_weight_err = error caused by output weight;<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(each hidden node) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hidden_weight_err = error caused by hidden weight;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(each input node)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new_hidden_weight = old weight + weight change;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new_output_weight = old weight + weight change;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#125;<br/>
}
</blockquote>

<p>As seen from the pseudocode above, there are a few clear avenues for parallelism in the algorithm. Specifically, the weighted sum and error update portions can be easily parallelized. Although, parallelization with respect to test data points does not immediately follow from this code, we plan to modify the algorithm to accommodate. </p>

<a id="challenge" class="anchor" href="#challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenge</h2>

<p>Designing hardware to solve any problem is frequently a more challenging way to develop a computer solution to a problem. The main challenge in this space will be porting a Neural Network solver to the System Verilog hardware description language. The solver will likely utilize some interesting hardware algorithms for pipelining the processes to make maximum use of the hardware. </p>

<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h2>

<p>FPGAs are the best hardware prototyping tool and are more popular than ever, with the new focus on solving problems on energy sensitive devices. Machine learning has become a mature field, and its algorithms are becoming only more commonplace. It is foreseeable that mobile devices could have an integrated ML chip in them in order to open up a whole new area of applications. This project aims to explore a specific case of these algorithms in the form of Neural Networks.</p>

<h2>
<a id="checkpoint-software-side" class="anchor" href="#checkpoint-software-side" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Checkpoint - Software Side</h2>

<p>The software side of this project revolves around tuning the neural network implementation on the computer. We have written and tested a working parallel implementation of a neural network with one hidden layer. The implementation parallelizes over nodes in each layer. The concurrency comes from the weighted sums calculated using matrix multiplication. We used the openmp abstraction in order to implement this.</p>

<p>We have decided to use a song popularity classification dataset to test our implementation. The reason is because the final FPGA implementation could be embedded into a cell phone and used as a tool to determine whether or not a song will be popular. Specifically, the input is an array of song properties such as length, bpm, etc. and the output is a number representing how popular the song will be. The neural network will be trained using historical data from the past few years.</p>

<p>We have finished coding the bulk of the PC-side part of the project and plan to tune the parameters passed into the neural network before publishing analysis. In addition, we have only tested the implementation using mock datasets, so we are still unsure of whether or not it will end up being a useful application.</p>

<p>The most glaring issue is that our simple neural network may not be able to produce accurate results. During the process of tweaking parameters, we may realize that we have chosen an inappropriate dataset. If this ends up being the case, we will switch to a simpler one: taking in exam grades and calculating the final average. The design of our neural network should make this task easy, however there are less feasible applications that could be around this.</p>

<p>In terms of the software side, the only goal left is the final tuning and analysis. This should be completed by Bohan Li within the week. Afterwards, both partners will be working on porting the code to hardware.</p>
